                <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
                <h3>STUDIO 3 learning journal</h3>
                <p>
                    I totally agree with the author's statements about what make a good game design, but I also questioning if these statements still work in today's game design world.<br>
                    I am not a big gamer but I think I did play every major games on the market, and I find there is something tricky about game design. The game must be designed to fit the need of a certain group of customers, and I am the one that looking for a game with great customizability, and attracting story behind the game mechanism. But I saw so many people spend so much time on playing simple, mobile games that I never find them interesting to me, just like tiktok videos. And I find those games are actually the ones that most profitable to the developers. I was wondering if I judge the game in a way too subjective or narrow.<br>
                    So I dowloaded a game on my phone, a simple pool game, just stimulating playing pool but you have to put bet in it. I met a guys who keeps missing shot and requesting rematch with me, and I found that the game keeps both of us playing with this mechanism. This is just an example of my new perspective of game design, all the game need to do is bring users the fun, and everyone have their own type of fun they are looking for. So the first thing we need to know in game design is who this game is for.

                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                <h3>STUDIO 2 learning journal</h3>
                <p>
                    For the visual thinking analysis, the first photo is from my peer's Every Photo project. She is also from China, and I recognized this photo for the first glance that this is in Taiguli, Chengdu. It is really interesting because I have actually been there, the exact same crossroad in the photo, for several times. The front view have passengers riding electric bikes, and two of them are food delivery guys, and in the back there is a massive panda status hanging on the wall. The focal point of this photo is the IFS mall, with high-rising building on the top. This photo is showing a scene of a busy city, and the blury motion of the vihchels enhanced the visual perception of the audience. The reflect on the ground is suggesting a rain, which complete the scene of a city that located in a humid basin. Interestingly, this photo became the media that introduced my peer to me, we've never talk before but we know each other after we shared this photo.<br>
                    For my choice of photo, that I am going to use in my own project, I picked this B&W photo that I took 5 years ago on a canon af35. I like this photo because it is so ambiguous, there is a face of a boy on the left side, and some highlight spots on the right. Even myself take a while to figure out where and what this photo is, the boy is actually the graphic of my friend's T-shirt, but the angle make it looks like a boy that no taller than the table standing there with only his face showing. And the highlight spots are the reflection of glasses because we were at the coffee shop I worked that night. It is really interesting to remember those scenes again by looking at a hidden photo, and this photo is really a great example of the visual thinking analysis. Plus, this photo is also really cool, it has very dramatic ligh and shadow contrast.<br>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                <h3>STUDIO 2 learning journal</h3>
                <p>
                    Michael Gonchar's article teaches the readers to use visual thinking skills to help them better understand complex information contained in the photos. By asking open ended questions and taking closer observations, the readers can take photos as a great source of inspiration.<br>
                    I have a great interest in photography, as a relatively new category of art, photography is a great way to capture and express the world around us. I think it is a great way to learn and understand the world around us, and I think it is a great way to communicate with others. Just like how Gonchar mentioned, expand knowledge of the world and start communication with others by extracting visual information out of photos need the audiences to have the ability to use visual thinking skills.<br>
                    As the further I went with my EveryPicture project development, I realized that there are so many photo lied in my folder for years, that I never take a closer, detective look at them because they are not considered as good by the standard. Many of them are the result of the shutter or light meter issue occured on my old camera. But after I took a closer look at them, I realized that there are so many great details in them, and they do have the potential to be processed and used as a source of inspiration.

                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <h3>STUDIO 1 learning journal</h3>
                <p>In "Overuse of Overlays" by Kathryn Whitenton, the author talk about two aspect of the use of overlays, which is the user experience and working mechaisms. Kathryn mentioned that if you are using multiple navigation mechanisms in one overlay, you should stop, which suggesting an important point when design overlays, it should be simple to use<br>
                Usually, overlays are not designed to achieve complicated task, it should only works as a reminder, or gicing a promotional message, a little user information form, otherwise, it will be very annoying to the user. The overlay should not just popping out every where, it should be distincted from the background and have a clear exit. <br>

                <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
                <h3>STUDIO 1 learning journal</h3>
                <p>
                    In the article, Best practice for form design, the author gave a list of bullet points to follow in order to make a good form design.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Minimizing the Input fields</li>
                        <li>2. One Column Layout</li>
                        <li>3. Multiple Steps</li>
                        <li>4. Ask the easy question first</li>
                        <li>5. Distinguish Optional and Required fields</li>
                        <li>6. Explain any input or formatting requirments</li>
                        <li>7. Label</li>
                        <li>8. Placeholder Text</li>
                        <li>9. Size fields Accordingly</li>
                        <li>10. Be careful with default values</li>
                        <li>11. Auto-focues first input field</li>
                        <li>12. Minimize dropdown menus</li>
                        <li>13. Making a form Tab-Ready</li>
                        <li>14. Provide Matching Keyboard</li>
                        <li>15. Asking for Sensitive Information:</li>
                        <li>16. Provide Show Password Option:</li>
                        <li>17. Action button:</li>
                        <li>18. Form Feedback:</li>
                        <li>19. Never use a Reset or Clear button:</li>
                        <li>20. Accessibility</li>
                    </ul>
                    Overall, the author suggests designers to consider from the users' side of view, in order to have higher efficiency when the form became a channel of communication. The form should be able to leading the users to accurately input the information required without getting confuse of distracted by the design of the interface.<br>

                    I find it really interesting to see the author said "never use reset button", even though I have never accidentaly hit the reset button on any form I filled, but I can image how frustrating it could be to the users. But an effective way to clear the form, or partially clear the form should be a really practical function in web design in cases like filling out address or card information. Refreshing the page risking loose all the information filled, but if there is a clear button with alert, that should make filling out long forms more tolerable.
